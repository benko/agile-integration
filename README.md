Agile Integration Technology Overview Materials
===============================================

The Purpose of this Repository
------------------------------

The source code and other files in this repository are supposed to be used as
companions to the Agile Integration Technology Overview recorded with Red Hat
in August 2019.

Content and Structure
---------------------

There are essentially three technologies we are showcasing:

 - Red Hat Fuse (with Apache Camel)
 - Red Hat AMQ
 - Red Hat 3scale

Each of the above lives in a separate subdirectory with accompanying source
code and documentation in their respective locations.

Additionally, there is a simple dummy PHP app that can be used to showcase
OpenShift language detection, image building, and deployment capability.
